Subject: [PATCH 1/2] gcc10 extern YYLOC global declaration

Based on https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/4/1/1206. In original patch, YYLOC declaration was removed.
However, using original patch, which removes yylloc declaration on 3.18.14 kernel version results in 'yylloc not declared' error.
See part of the original description below:

gcc 10 will default to -fno-common, which causes this error at link
time:

  (.text+0x0): multiple definition of `yylloc'; dtc-lexer.lex.o (symbol from plugin):(.text+0x0): first defined here

This is because both dtc-lexer as well as dtc-parser define the same
global symbol yyloc. Before with -fcommon those were merged into one
defintion. The proper solution would be to to mark this as "extern",
